- The main variables we would want to focus on are the intercept (which is significant but should factor into the variablity), vehicle length and ground clearance. 

- The slope is non-zero. This is understood because the p-value of 5.35 e-11 is less than 0.05

- The linear model does predict the mpg effectively. The r-squared value of .7149, means that the linear model accounts for 71& of the variability in the mpg. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Overall they are within the variance of 100 psi. They are averaging a variance of 62.29. When you look at the individual lots, lot 1 & 2 are within spec. Lot 3 is excedding this with a variance of 170.29

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Overall they are within the standard 1500 PSI. With a p-value of .06 there is no evidence of statisical difference.

When looking at each lot, lots 1 & 2 have no statisical difference from the standard of 1500 PSI. Lot 3 is statistically lower that the standard of 1500 PSI with a mean of 1496.14 and a p-value of .042.
