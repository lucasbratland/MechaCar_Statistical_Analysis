- The main variables we would want to focus on are the intercept (which is significant but should factor into the variablity), vehicle length and ground clearance. 

- The slope is non-zero. This is understood because the p-value of 5.35 e-11 is less than 0.05

- The linear model does predict the mpg effectively. The r-squared value of .7149, means that the linear model accounts for 71& of the variability in the mpg.
